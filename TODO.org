* Fact parsing
** Support alternative arrow forms
Fact expectations support other arrow forms:
- [[https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Negating-arrows][Negating Arrows]] -- =not=> / =deny=>
- [[https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Macros][Macro Expansion]] -- =expands-to=>
** Tabular facts
See [[https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Tabular-facts][Tabular facts]].
** Streaming prerequisites
See [[https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Streaming-prerequisites][Streaming prerequisites]]
** Call counts in prerequisites
See [[https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Specifying-call-counts][Specifying call counts]].
It's not clear that these are necessary from a documentation perspective:
they are perhaps better considered to be an implementation detail.
But, we should at least ensure that they are safely ignored by the parser.
